This Project is all about leveraging the power of terraform to create resources on various providers and manage them easily at hand.

This project documents the various terraform commands, variables, types used and learned during the process.

It is a resume graded project which surely shows the knowledge of terraform you have.

Learnt a lot from the project.

A Terra_files/proj_documented.docx file is there which will help you know more about this.

ThankYou!
